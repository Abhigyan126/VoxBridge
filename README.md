# VoxBridge

**VoxBridge** is a simple peer-to-peer (P2P) voice chat application built with **React**, **WebRTC**, and **WebSockets**. It allows users to create or join chat groups using unique codes and establish real-time audio communication directly between browsers â€” no server-side media relay.
